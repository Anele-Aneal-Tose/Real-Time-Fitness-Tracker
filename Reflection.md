# Reflection
___
<p>Balancing stakeholder needs posed challenges, especially in prioritizing feature requests. 

Fitness enthusiasts demanded real-time feedback, whereas health professionals required data accuracy and consistency. 
Ensuring both needs were met required designing a robust data processing mechanism. 
Similarly, business owners focused on monetization while system administrators emphasized security. 
Trade-offs were necessary to ensure performance without compromising security. 
The iterative Agile approach helped refine requirements through stakeholder feedback.</p>

<p>For assignment 5, the process of translating high-level system and stakeholder requirements into detailed use 
cases and corresponding test cases posed several challenges. One major challenge was ensuring that the use cases derived 
from the system requirements document were both comprehensive and detailed enough to capture the complete interactions 
within the system. For instance, the functional requirements outlined in Assignment 4 provided a broad overview of 
capabilities such as real-time fitness tracking, personalized workout recommendations, and report generation. 
However, it was necessary to decompose these high-level requirements into specific, actionable use cases that could 
be validated through testing.</p>

<p>A significant difficulty was balancing stakeholder needs while maintaining technical feasibility. The Fitness 
Enthusiast and Trainer roles, for example, had overlapping needs—both required access to fitness data, 
yet each with different priorities. To address this, the use case “Access Client Data” was defined specifically for the 
Trainer while ensuring that general data tracking and display were covered under separate use cases. This separation 
allowed for more granular test case development, ensuring that each functionality could be independently validated.</p>

<p>Another challenge was incorporating non-functional requirements such as performance and security into the test cases. 
These aspects are not typically as straightforward to test as functional requirements. For example, verifying that the 
dashboard loads within two seconds under peak load required simulating concurrent user sessions, which in turn 
necessitated a careful design of test scenarios that mimic real-world usage. </p>

<p>Moreover, ensuring consistency across documents—ranging from the use case diagram to the detailed specifications and 
finally to the test cases—required iterative reviews and refinements. Each artifact needed to be traceable to the 
original stakeholder requirements. The iterative approach recommended in the module guidelines helped in refining the 
use cases and test scenarios. Agile principles played a crucial role here; regular feedback from peers and stakeholders 
was instrumental in aligning the deliverables with both business needs and technical constraints.
</p>

<p>Lastly, the clarity and documentation of these artifacts are vital for future development stages. In our reflection, 
it became evident that detailed specifications and clear test cases not only facilitate better communication between 
developers and testers but also ensure that any modifications or enhancements to the system can be seamlessly integrated. 
This documentation will serve as a reference throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring that the system evolves without 
deviating from stakeholder expectations.</p>
