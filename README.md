### Explanation of Customization
* Added ‘Testing’ column: To align with QA requirements and validate completed tasks.
* Added ‘Blocked’ column: To highlight any blockers impeding development progress.
* Used Labels: "tasks", "user story" for better issue tracking.
* Assigned team members: Ensured ownership and accountability for tasks.

### Kanban Board Explanation
<p>A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage work by displaying tasks in different stages of progress. 
It enhances workflow transparency and efficiency by enabling teams to track task statuses in real-time.</p>

#### How Our Board Supports Agile
* Visualizing Workflow: Columns represent different stages (To Do, In Progress, Testing, Done) to provide clear 
* visibility.
* Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP): The board ensures no more than three tasks per developer at a time, reducing overload.
* Supporting Agile Principles: Encourages continuous delivery by tracking real-time progress and adaptability through 
* easy task re-prioritization.
